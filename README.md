# Ethereum Fraud Detection üöÄ

Fraudulent and legitimate transactions on the Ethereum blockchain are analyzed in this project. Ethereum, launched in 2015 by **Vitalik Buterin** and **Gavin Wood**, is the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, accounting for over 17% of the $1.2 trillion global crypto market.

While Bitcoin focuses on being a medium of exchange, Ethereum serves as a **decentralized computing network** that supports smart contracts and dApps (decentralized applications).

## What is ERC20? ü§î

ERC20 is a **standard for fungible tokens** on the Ethereum blockchain. It acts as a guide for creating tokens that are interchangeable with other smart contract tokens.

### Key Differences Between ETH and ERC20:
- **ETH**: The native cryptocurrency of Ethereum, used for paying transaction fees (gas) and enabling operations.
- **ERC20**: Tokens created on Ethereum for specific use cases, such as stablecoins or decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms.

### Use Cases for ERC20 Tokens:
1. **DeFi Platforms**: Power decentralized financial applications.
2. **Stablecoins**: Pegged tokens like USDT and USDC.
3. **Gaming and NFTs**: Support in-game currencies and digital collectibles.
